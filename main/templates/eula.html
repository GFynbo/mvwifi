                    <p>Charges, Fees, and Taxes That You Must Pay. You agree to pay all charges associated with the Services, including, but not limited to, installation charges, monthly service charges, Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc Equipment (as defined below) charges, service call charges, applicable federal, state, and local taxes (however designated) and any fees or payment obligations imposed by governmental or quasi-governmental bodies for the sale, installation, use, or provision of the Services. You agree to pay any regulatory recovery fees which Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc invoices you for municipal, state and federal government fees or assessments imposed on Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc , or any programs in which Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc participates, including, but not limited to, public, educational and governmental access, universal service, telecom relay services for the visually/hearing impaired, rights-of-way access, and programs supporting 911/E911 system. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY GOVERNMENT IMPOSED FEES AND TAXES THAT BECOME APPLICABLE RETROACTIVELY. We will provide you with notice and an effective date of any change in our prices or fees, unless the change in price is related to a change in governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, fees or assessments, in which case we may elect not to provide notice except where required by applicable law. Not all fees apply to all Services. </p>

                    <p>Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc service is provided as pre-paid terms in one (1) month, three (3) month, six (6) month, and twelve (12) month service periods. The cost of the service plan and any installation costs must be paid before service will be activated. The customer may cancel service at any time, but if it is prior to the term expiration, the account will be converted to the one (1) month rate (with the same number of users/devices) and any refund will be calculated by multiplying that rate for the number of months the service was active. Any overpayment after that calculation will be refunded via check with 30 days after any installed equipment has been returned. If the calculation creates an amount due to Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc the account will be cancelled without refund. </p>

                    <p>One (1) day and one (1) week accounts that have been used at least once are non-refundable. It is the customers responsibility to verify their signal strength prior to signing up for service. Browsing speed and dependability can be tested prior to account activation by browsing our website (http://www.chappywisp.com) and bringing up the various webpages and webcams. </p>

                    <p>Third-Party Charges That Are Your Responsibility. You acknowledge that you may incur charges with third-party service providers that are separate and apart from the amounts charged by us. These may include charges resulting from accessing on-line services, calling parties who charge for their telephone-based services, purchasing or subscribing to other offerings via the Internet or Interactive options on your Video Service, if applicable, or otherwise. You are solely responsible for all charges payable to third parties, including all applicable taxes. In addition, you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card and other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions. </p>

                    <p>Alternative Billing Arrangements. In certain cases, Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc may agree to provide billing services on behalf of third parties, as the agent of the third party. Any such third-party charges shall be payable pursuant to any contract or other arrangement between you and the third party. We shall not be responsible for any dispute regarding these charges between you and any third party. You must address all such disputes directly with the third party. </p>

                    <p>Payment by Credit Card or Check. If you use a credit card to pay for the Services, that use is governed by the card issuer agreement for that card, and you must refer to that agreement for your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.

If you make payment by check, you authorize Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc to collect your check electronically.

Fees Not Considered Interest or Penalties: Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc does not anticipate that you will fail to pay for the Services on a timely basis, and we do not extend credit to customers. Any fees, charges, and assessments due to late payment or nonpayment are not interest, credit service charges, or finance charges or penalties. Rather, they are liquidated damages intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of our costs resulting from late payments and non-payments. These costs will be difficult to calculate or to predict when we set such fees, charges, and assessments, because we cannot know in advance: (a) whether you will pay for the Services on a timely basis, if ever; (b) if you do pay late, when you will actually pay; and (c) what costs we will incur because of your late payment or non-payment. </p>

                    <p>Collection Costs: If we are required to use a collection agency or attorney to collect money owed by you, you agree to pay the reasonable costs of collection. These costs include but are not limited to any collection agency's fees, reasonable attorneys' fees, and arbitration or court costs.

Reconnection Fees and Related Charges. Should you wish to resume a Service after any suspension, we may require you to pay a reconnection fee. Should you wish to reinstate any or all Services after disconnection, we may require you to pay an installation fee and/or service activation fee. These fees are in addition to all past due charges and other fees. Reconnection of the Services is subject to our credit policies, this Agreement and applicable law. </p>

YOU AUTHORIZE Chappy WISP / mvWiFi llc TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CREDIT EXPERIENCE FROM OTHERS, TO ENTER THIS INFORMATION IN YOUR FILE, AND TO DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION CONCERNING YOU TO APPROPRIATE THIRD PARTIES FOR REASONABLE BUSINESS PURPOSES. </p>
