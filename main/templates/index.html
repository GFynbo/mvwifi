                    <p>The Town and residents have been trying to solve the
                    shortage of modern technology and communication on Chappy
                    for over 7 years. There have been three committees and
                    various false starts. In 2008 I started Chappy WISP to
                    bring high speed Internet to all of Chappy. In 2015 Comcast
                    wired Chappy and in 2016 we got the temporary cell tower
                    from AT&amp;T. This is the final step towards that goal.</p>
